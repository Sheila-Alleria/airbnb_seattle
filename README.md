## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The libraries used in this analysis process include:
pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyploy, seaborn, scipy, PIL, requests, io, sklearn

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb Open data in 2016 to better understand:

1. On average, which areas/neighborhoods have Airbnbs with higher attractiveness (more popular)?
2. How attractive Airbnbs are different from not-so-attractive Airbnbs?
3. What features are more important for attractiveness?

Overall, there are two purposes of this project:

1. Get insights of the questions from the dataset via data analysis process
2. Self-training for Github

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps. 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Airbnb for the data.  
The dataset used in this analysis can be obtained at [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle)
You can find the Licensing for the data and other data at [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
